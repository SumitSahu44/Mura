## MURA: MUsculoskeletal RAdiographs
# Overview

The MURA model is an advanced machine learning application that analyzes X-ray images and determines whether they indicate abnormalities. Designed to assist healthcare professionals, this model provides quick and accurate diagnostic support, improving efficiency and patient outcomes.

# Features
- ðŸ©» X-Ray Image Classification: Detects abnormalities in medical X-ray images.
- âš¡ Fast Inference: Provides rapid predictions for real-time analysis.
- ðŸ§  Powered by AI: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
- ðŸŽ¯ High Accuracy: Trained on a large dataset of labeled X-ray images.
- ðŸ”’ Secure API: Integrates easily with hospital systems via secure endpoints.

# Tech Stack
- Model: TensorFlow/Keras
- Backend: FastAPI/Flask
- Frontend: React

# Workflow
- Input: Upload an X-ray image (JPEG/PNG format).
- Processing:
   - Preprocessing the image (e.g., resizing, normalization).
   - Feeding the image into the trained ML model.
- Output: A prediction indicating whether the X-ray is normal or abnormal.
